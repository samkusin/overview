# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global


# Ignore everything but what is absolutely needed for the cinek build system.
# We do this to allow building of modules inside this folder without the need
# to include any modules in the repository.
